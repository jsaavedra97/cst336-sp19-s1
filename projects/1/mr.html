            In a way, Mixed Reality is a much more enhanced version of Augmented Reality, yet it also has it's differences. To quote one of the articles in the header, "Mixed Reality, also referred as Hybrid Reality is a combination or merging of real and virtual worlds, where both of them can co-exist and interact in real time. Usually, in the mixed reality environment, users will be able to navigate through the real and virtual world at the same time. Instead of replacing the real world, mixed enhances it, offering access to digital information on top of the world in front of us."
            This is the idea of two realities interacting with one another. Allowing for an enhanced interaction experience that can provide limitless oppurtunties in the future. The possibiliteis on Mixed Reality are near limitless as we develop and enhance the technology associated with it.
