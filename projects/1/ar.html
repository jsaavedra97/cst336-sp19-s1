                    Augmented Reality, simply put, overlays 3D generated graphics, images, and even data into our normal everyday world through the view of a camera.
                    Accessibility is easy as only a smart phone and an AR app are required. By using the camera in your smart phone, the app calculates and projects 
                    the image into the enviornment from the point of view of your camera! An example of an Augmented Reality app would be Pokemon GO! as seen in the
                    example video, enjoy the video!
