            <p>Virtual Reality is a simulated and immersive experience projected by a device into the user’s sight. The user is then cut off from their enviornment and plunged into the digital realm. Imagine a digital world with various locations, games, and other experiences that await you while you sit at home!</p>
            <p> Commonly, a headset is needed to project you into a simulation. It requires a set of lenses inside a viewport on a headset, a mounted device where the experience is computed, and a remote control that is synced up to the headset which allows the user to interact with the 3D space around them!</p>
